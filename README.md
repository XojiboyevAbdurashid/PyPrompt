### ~~Based on~~ Stole from [Termithon | idkDwij](https://github.com/IdkDwij/Termithon)

~~For version 2.0 of PyPrompt, I am planning to make the shell NOT based on Termithon for once!~~ 

~~When v2 releases~~, this repo will be ~~read only and archived!~~ ERASED. (update july 2023: maybe ill abandon this idek bro)

Update october 2024: yeah this is dead.

## Run this in your PC (do not.)

#### PYPROMPT DEVELOPMENT, BETA BUILDS, UNCOMPILED BUILDS

Install [Python](https://python.org) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) ~~(ONLY FOR PYPROMPT DEVELOPMENT)~~


#### STABLE VERSIONS (CURRENTLY ON 1.6.1)


Download the binary in the Releases tab. Nothing else. (PYVIM AND PYINSTALLER REQUIRE PYTHON)


For stable builds: download the binary or the setup from the 'Releases' tab.

### TO RUN IN WINDOWS TERMINAL

locate your downloaded release (pyprompt.exe) and copy it to the root of your C drive and make a new profile named PyPrompt, use the following command ```C:\pyprompt.exe``` once you copy it, it should work.

### What happened to PyPrompt Development Kit?

~~Just get the source code from here and use the stable release that includes pyinstaller and auto py to exe (requires python + required modules) to compile your own version! Make sure to download the speedtest.py file in this repo to compile with Pyinstaller.~~

why does a termial need a development kit to begin with smh.

## Features:

There's a lot... ~~that might or might not work~~
